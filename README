# User Creation Script

This script allows you to create users in a Bitbucket server using a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following:

- Python installed on your system
- The `requests` library installed (`pip install requests`)

   Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

   Create a virtual environment by running the following command:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a new directory named `venv` that contains the virtual environment.

   Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:

   - For Windows:

     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

Once activated, you will see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install the necessary Python packages specified in the requirements.txt file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have a Bitbucket server running. If your server is running on a different URL or port, update the `url` variable in the script accordingly.

3. Prepare a CSV file named `users.csv` with the following format:

   ```csv
   username,display_name,password,email
   john_doe,John Doe,pass123,johndoe@example.com
   jane_smith,Jane Smith,pass456,janesmith@example.com

   Each row represents a user, with four columns: username, display_name, password, and email. You can add as many users as needed.

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

   Run the script using the following command:

   The script will read the users.csv file and create users in the Bitbucket server.

   Check the output in the terminal to see the status of user creation. If any errors occur, they will be displayed in the terminal.

   Verify the user creation by logging in to your Bitbucket server and checking the user list.

   Troubleshooting
   If you encounter any issues or errors while running the script, please make sure you have met all the prerequisites and followed the instructions correctly.

   Update the url variable in the script to match the correct URL and port.

   Feel free to customize the README file according to your specific requirements and provide any additional instructions or information that may be relevant.
